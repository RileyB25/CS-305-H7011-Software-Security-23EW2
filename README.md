Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. These financial plans encompass savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company wanted to modernize its operations, including updating software requirements, and is actively seeking ways to protect client and financial data.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I would recommend setting up a plan on how to secure vulnerabilities because it is quite easy to use a dependency checker to identify and address issues. It is crucial to code securely because a small mistake can escalate into a significant one. Some of the best hackers only need one small vulnerability to access your information. Software security adds value by ensuring that the information you want to store and protect from hackers remains secure, preventing potential disruptions for a company where they might have to inform customers that their important information has been compromised and no company wants to do that.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I would say that getting secure communications was a pain in the butt because I encountered issue after issue.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase layers of security, I would recommend using a certificate for secure communication. Additionally, I would use a dependency checker to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques. The dependency checker helps identify and address potential issues in the code, contributing to a more secure software.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The first step is to run and test the program. After refactoring it, the next check involves running another dependency check, which should highlight any vulnerabilities. This process ensures that the code and software application remain functional and secure.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I often refer to YouTube videos when encountering issues, as I look up solutions or check if others have faced similar problems. Alternatively, I seek assistance from my uncle or grandpa, both of whom hold CS degrees.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would showcase the Certificate generation and exportation aspects of this assignment, as well as the dependency checker, because I felt most confident in those areas.
